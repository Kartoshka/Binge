## What is it?
Its a bird, its a plane, its a Binge!

Binge is a tv show suggestion engine. It allows you to rate shows, get suggestions and save them for later.

## Getting started
Use the **Search** tab to find tv shows you've watched, then click the stars to rate them.

You can see and edit the movies you've rated in the **Rated** tab.

In the **Recommended** tab you will find suggestions based on your rated movies.

If a recommended movie interests you, click +watchlist to add it to the **WatchList** tab.

Binge will remember your ratings and watchlist for your next Netflix (and chill?) session.
