# Design Process Description

## Brainstorming

## The Main Sections
We then decided on which main sections (features) we wanted to have in our project:
- Search: This is where a user can search for TV shows he/she has watched in order to rate them and get better suggestions. It can also be used as a way to add shows directly to the WatchList, for example if a show was recommended by a friend.
- Rated: All TV shows that were given a rating are listed in this section. It thus shows previously wacthed series and can be used as an history of what was watched. The shows here are sorted by rating, the best ratings starting on the left.
- WatchList: Here are listed all shows added to the 'WatchList' by the user. This can and should be used as a way to manage a list of TV shows that a user wants to watch at a later date.
- Recommended: The TV shows recommended by our suggestion algorithm are presented to the user there. If nothing was rated, it simply displays the most popular TV shows. This is the **most important** section as it is the main purpose of this application.

Note that a TV show cannot appear in more than one of the following sections: Rated, WatchList and Recommended. This ensures that the recommendation list keeps evolving over time and that shows that have already been watched are not suggested to the user again.
